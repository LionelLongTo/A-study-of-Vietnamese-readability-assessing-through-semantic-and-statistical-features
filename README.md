A study of Vietnamese readability assessing through semantic and statistical features

Revolutionize text difficulty assessment in Vietnamese with our novel approach integrating statistical and semantic methodologies. 

Leveraging datasets like ViRead, OneStopEnglish, and RACE translated into Vietnamese, we employ advanced language models (PhoBERT, ViDeBERTa, ViBERT) for semantic analysis and extract syntactic and lexical features using statistical methods.

Through experiments with SVM, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, our joint approach showcases a significant improvement in accuracy and F1 score for readability classification, highlighting the importance of considering both linguistic and semantic aspects. 

This project sets the stage for advancing research in Vietnamese text complexity assessment and demonstrates the adaptability of advanced language models in this context
